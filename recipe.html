<h3>recipe</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place finely chopped chocolate into a heat-proof glass or metal bowl.</li>
    <li>Heat cream on the stovetop until just simmering. If itâ€™s boiling, the cream is too hot and could separate or even burn the chocolate. Once you see little simmers around the edges, turn off the heat and immediately pour the warm cream over the chocolate.</li>
    <li>Let the 2 sit for a few minutes before stirring.</li>
    <li>Stir slowly until smooth.</li>
